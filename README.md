# The-Digital-Deluge

As we approach April 2019, dawn of the first anniversary of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) written into law by the EU in 2018, questions regarding consumer data analytics have reached an all time high. The trust of data collection and privacy in Silicon Valley has plummeted, following scandals such as Facebookâ€™s Cambridge Analytica debacle. In response to such growing global concern, it seems fitting to exploit GDPR legislation, introduced last year, to uncover the current state of digital data privacy.

## TLDR: How do I analyse my own data?

### Step 0: Find out which companies store data on you

Go through you browser history, password manager, bookmarks and social media for any possible company. Write down the list of companies you wish to audit.

### Step 1: GDPR requests

Request all your data from all those companies identified in step 0 who store [Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information) about you. Facebook, Twitter, Telegram and others offer automated tools that you can find in your privacy settings. Others need to be contacted directly by email using a standard email request. A good place to start is [here](https://mydatarequest.com/).

### Step 2: Analyse your data

Check out the [tools folder](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/The-Digital-Deluge/tree/master/tools) and the associated ReadMe file for all the written code and 3rd party tools used for GDPR data analysis. More tools to be added at later date.
